# Top 10 List of Week 06

1. [Operating System: Threads and Concurrency](https://medium.com/@akhandmishra/operating-system-threads-and-concurrency-aec2036b90f8)<br>
This is a medium article explaining about Threads and Concurrency. 
It explains pretty much everything about Threads and Concurrency as well as the synchronization mechanism between process. 
It's really amusing reading this article because of how the article groups information into byte-sized categories with images. 

2. [Process States](https://www.javatpoint.com/os-process-states)<br>
This article on JavaPoint explains about Process States. 
It explains on the processes of creating, suspending, pause, and terminating process. 
There's an image of the state diagram that explains it easier. 
I found it a bit triggering seeing the diagram because it reminds me of a course.

3. [Inter Process Communication (IPC)](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/inter-process-communication-ipc/)<br>
This article from Geeks for Geeks explains about Inter Process Communication. 
It explains about independent and co-operating process, shared memory, and message passing. 
The article doesn't only explains the subjects, but it also shows the code implementation as well. 

4. [Remote Procedure Call (RPC) in Operating System](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/remote-procedure-call-rpc-in-operating-system/)<br>
Again, an article from Geeks for Geeks explaining about Remote Procedure Call (RPC). 
It explains on the underlying mechanism as well as some advantages and issues. 
I find it interesting that RPC exists, It reminds me of how complex Operating Systems are and how genius people make workarounds on some issues about it (and create another issues). 

5. [Difference between Asymmetric and Symmetric Multiprocessing](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/difference-between-asymmetric-and-symmetric-multiprocessing/)<br>
Another Geeks for Geeks article explaining the difference between Asymmetric and Symmetric Multiprocessing. 
This article pretty much just explains what Asymmetric and Symmetric Multiprocessing is and show the difference table between them. 
This article is simple and on point, might be useful on emergency time like in the middle of a quiz.

6. [Preemptive and Non-Preemptive Scheduling](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/preemptive-and-non-preemptive-scheduling)<br>
This article is almost the same as the previous one, but it explains about Preemptive and None-Preemptive Scheduling. 
The same as Geeks for Geeks, TutorialsPoint laid out the information in bite-sized, simple, and easy to read as well as showing the difference table. 
This would also useful on emergency time, or probably just for easy read. 

7. [Operating System - Processes](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/operating_system/os_processes.htm)<br>
Another article from TutorialsPoint that explains about Operating System's Processes. 
It explains the components, life cycle, and Process Control Block of a process. 
The article is simple, on point, and easy to read on sunday morning while doing OS assignments. 

8. [Process Creation vs Process Termination in Operating System](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/process-creation-vs-process-termination-in-operating-system)<br>
As you guessed it, another article from TutorialsPoint and this time it's about process creation and termination. 
It's the same as other 'versus article', where it's simple and easy to read and also shows the difference table. 
It also shows the diagram of fork process of a process. 

9. [Cooperating processes in the Operating System](https://www.includehelp.com/operating-systems/cooperating-processes-in-the-operating-system.aspx)<br>
As the name suggests, this article explains about cooperating process in Operating System. 
This article explains the mechanism as well as the prerequisite for it. 
It also shows some example code implementations and with shared memory.

10. [Message Passing vs Shared Memory Process communication Models](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/message-passing-vs-shared-memory-process-communication-models)<br>
Another article from TutorialsPoint that explains about message passing and shared memory process. 
The same as other articles, it explains the subject in simple and easy way, but this time without difference table. 
Nevertheless, it shows the diagram of the process that further support the explanation.
