# Top 10 List of Week 07

1. [Cooperating processes in the Operating System](https://www.includehelp.com/operating-systems/cooperating-processes-in-the-operating-system.aspx)<br>
As the name implies this article explains about cooperating processes in the Operating System. 
It explains about the benefits on implementing cooperating processes, the effects, and real world example. 
I found it interesting that the article give some code implementations, thus support the article's materials.

2. [Introduction to DEADLOCK in Operating System](https://www.guru99.com/deadlock-in-operating-system.html)<br>
This article from guru99 explains about deadlocks, which is a state where multiple process enters waiting state because of each other. 
It explains the underlying definition of deadlock, detection, prevention, even the advantages of it. 
It also gives a brief overview of the difference between deadlock and starvation. 

3. [What is race condition](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/34510/what-is-a-race-condition)<br>
This is a forum on StackOverflow that discusses about race condition. 
It's a condition where two or more threads can access shared data and try to change it at the same time. 
Many of the answers gave code examples to better explain the topic. 
I found it interesting where different answers gave different examples. 

4. [Process Synchronization](https://www.studytonight.com/operating-system/process-synchronization#)<br>
This article from studytonight explains about process synchronization. 
The article explains about the underlying definition, a brief about cooperative process, and critical section problem. 
I found it interesting that the article explains almost all important information regarding the topic with images to support it. 

5. [Monitors vs Semaphores](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/monitors-vs-semaphores)<br>
This article from tutorialspoint explains about, you guessed it, the difference between Monitors and Semaphores. 
It explains each about Monitors and Semaphores, with also some code examples. 
Although it doesn't present the difference tables like Geeeks4Geeks, the explanation is concise enough to grasps as light reading.

6. [Recovery from Deadlock in Operating System](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/recovery-from-deadlock-in-operating-system/)<br>
This article from Geeks4Geeks explains about recovery from deadlocks. 
This brief article explains about the underlying explanation, process termination, and resource preemption. 
The information presented is concise and easy to grasps for light reading. 

7. [Peterson’s Algorithm in Process Synchronization](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/petersons-algorithm-in-process-synchronization/)<br>
This article explains about Peterson's Algorithm in Process Synchronization. 
This algorithm is usually used to synchronize two processes where two processes as producers and consumers shared one heap memory. 
This article is so interesting because the explanation is clear and presented with code implementation. 

8. [Banker’s Algorithm in Operating System](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/bankers-algorithm-in-operating-system-2/)<br>
Another article explains about the Banker's algorithm from Geeks4Geeks. 
This algorithm is used in a resource allocation scenario to avoid deadlocks and make sure to utilize all resources. 
In this article, it explains the underlying problems and some code implementations. 

9. [Readers-Writers Problem](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/readers-writers-problem-set-1-introduction-and-readers-preference-solution/)<br>
This article explains about the Readers-Writers problem. 
This problem is about the mechanism between different reading and writing process on a single file. 
This article explains about the problem, solutions, and also the code implementations to support the topic. 

10. [Starvation and Aging in Operating Systems](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/starvation-and-aging-in-operating-systems/)<br>
This article from Geeks4Geeks explains about Starvation and Aging in Operating Systems. 
It explains the underlying definition of Starvation and Aging, the differences, and solutions to it. 
The article explains the topic in concise and clear way with images to support the topic, thus it can be easily grasped for light reading.
