# Top 10 List of Week 04

1. [Pointer Power! (YouTube)](https://youtu.be/t5NszbIerYc)<br>
This is a high-level explanation of C pointers by Professor Brailsford in Computerphile. 
He explains the visual representation of pointers as well as the underlying C code. 
His funny yet enigmatic way of explanation using Legos really entertain me as I'm learning about pointers. 

2. [C/Pointers](https://www.cs.yale.edu/homes/aspnes/pinewiki/C(2f)Pointers.html)<br>
As a wise man said, after swimming on the surface, why not dive yourself deeper ? 
Surely that wise man never learned about c pointers, because that what you'll get by visiting this link ! 
This contains the more practical use of c pointers that you'll find on real world, including creating and using pointers, function pointers, arrays, null pointers, and the arithmetic. 
Surely, it'll be fun. 

3. [Linux Memory Management](https://tldp.org/LDP/tlk/mm/memory.html)<br>
Ever print a pointer address in C? 
Turns out, it was a lie! 
A good one to be sure, as it's actually an address of the program's Virtual Memory, not Physical Memory. 
It's the Operating System's deed to make sure to use the most out of your memory. 
Learn more about it here, as it explains the underlying system of Linux's Memory Management. 

4. [Page Tables Explained](https://github.com/lorenzo-stoakes/linux-vm-notes/blob/master/sections/page-tables.md)<br>
Well, those virtual memory management surely have a way to map virtual memory addresses to physical one. 
Worry no more! It's called Page Tables and you can learn it more in this GitHub repo. 
It contains explanations of the 4 levels of Page Tables with additional on how to do stuff about it. 

5. [Static, Shared Dynamic and Loadable Linux Libraries](http://www.yolinux.com/TUTORIALS/LibraryArchives-StaticAndDynamic.html)<br>
Have you encountered a file with .dll or .lib extensions and wonder what the heck this is? 
Well you'll ask no more question after learning about libraries in this website! 
These library files contains compiled codes that are used and shared among programs, so that it's reusable and manageable separately from your program. 
You can learn more here as you'll not only learn libraries on linux, but you'll also learn the comparison to the Windows version.

6. [Modern CMake Examples](https://github.com/pr0g/cmake-examples)<br>
CMake is a tool to control compilation process independent of platform or compiler. 
In this repo you'll find some useful examples that's commonly used for CMake. 
It also has a bunch other external learning materials. 

7. [Standard data types on Unix, Linux, and Windows](https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/en/SSFKSJ_9.0.0/com.ibm.mq.ref.dev.doc/q104610_.htm)<br>
Ever wondered how much bytes to store a clock_t data type ? 
Yeah, me neither. 
Well now you'll know it by visiting this website. 
It's pretty much just a table of length of standard data types from char to HANDLE (???). 
Yeah, I'm today's years old that I found out there's data types beyond double. 

8. [Differences between ASLR, KASLR and KARL](https://www.daniloaz.com/en/differences-between-aslr-kaslr-and-karl/)<br>
As I had pointed out about pointers (aha, get it?) and print it, it appears that the address changes randomly. 
It's actually a security measures called ASLR (and PIE) to randomize the program memory structures in virtual memory. 
It defends against known memory address attacks, like ROP, GOT & PLT, Ret2LibC, etc., so that it makes attacker difficult to predict target address. 
This article is about ASLR as well as it's implementation on kernel space.

9. [Processor Endianness and Data Representation](http://www.yolinux.com/TUTORIALS/Endian-Byte-Order.html)<br>
Tbh. till this day I still confused on interpreting endianess when reading binary dump. 
But it'll be more confusing if you even don't know about it. 
In this article, you'll learn the basics, conversion, swaps, as well as code examples. 

10. [GDB PEDA](https://github.com/longld/peda)<br>
This is one of two famous extensions for one of the famous command line binary executable debugger. 
The GNU Project Debugger (GDB) is a tool to allows you to see inside a program while it executes, whether it's the program stacks, memory, memory map, registers, etc. 
While the Python Exploit Development Assistance (PEDA) is an assistive extension to monitor those stuff. 
If you want to get your hands dirty on ELF Binaries, this one of the right tool to use. 
Other tools that I like to use are [radare2](https://www.radare.org/r/) and [Ghidra](https://ghidra-sre.org/).
