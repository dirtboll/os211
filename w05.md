This website contains materials about paging. 
It includes stuffs from Swapping to Page replacement algorithm. 
Although all of the images can't be loaded, simple and on point sites are rather easy to read and learn.

2. [Logical and Physical Address in Operating System](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/logical-and-physical-address-in-operating-system/)<br>
As always, Geeks for geeks at it's again with it's explanation about logical and physical address. 
It describes Logical and Physical Address with differences and comparisons. 
It has a nice UI to read and explains the material in clear and concise way.

3. [How many page flags do we really have?](https://lwn.net/Articles/335768/)<br>
As the name implies, it explains flags that we commonly have.

It ends it's description summaries and also has nice UI to read and learn. 

5. [Page Replacement Algorithms in Operating Systems](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/page-replacement-algorithms-in-operating-systems/)<br>
Another site from GfG that talks about Page Replacement Algorithms. 
As usual, it explains the materials in compact yet clear and important way. 
It explains what is a Page Fault and some algorithms about Page Replacement with images. 

6. [Page Replacement Algorithms](http://www.ecs.umass.edu/ece/koren/architecture/PReplace/)<br>
Ever stuck on Pop Quiz calculating for number of Page Faults? 
Probably that's bit late but this site could help you for it! 
It's simply a calculator and simulator on three Page Replacement Algorithms. 
It displays which page references miss in a table as well as other calculations.
