1. [Linux File System/Structure Explained! (YouTube)](https://youtu.be/HbgzrKJvDRw)<br>
As the name implies, this is a basic crash course explaination about Linux filesystems. 
It explains the difference between Windows and Linux filesystems as well as the underlying structure between the two. 
It's presented in bite-sized chunks explaining each main directories structure in engaging way. 

2. [Unix / Linux - File System Basics](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/unix/unix-file-system.htm)<br>
Personally, tutorialspoint is one of the best source to find tutorials. 
It not only contains brief explaination about the filesystems, it also contains useful and commonly used commands regarding to it. 
The site also contains other tutorials about Linux/UNIX and served in compact and interesting way. 

2. [Introduction to the Ext4 File System for Linux (YouTube)](https://youtu.be/B6kg2zeJ9do)<br>
It's a 1-hour introduction of Ext4 Linux File System. 
It's explained in a detail and concise way with the underlying base structure of the filesystem. 
It also explains the history of the filesystems, as well as it's previous versions. 

3. [How Do Linux Kernel Drivers Work? - Learning Resource (YouTube)](https://youtu.be/juGNPLdjLH4)<br>
An interesting video explaining a programmer experience on learning and exploring the Linux Kernel. 
It's based on a reference book Linux Device Drivers Third Edition, which is free and publicly available. 
He explains some important materials on getting started as well as some stuff he occasionaly stumbled upon learning. 

4. [Special Devices and File Systems](https://www.cs.rutgers.edu/~pxk/416/notes/14-specialfs.html)<br>
As the name implies, the website gives a brief intro about Linux special devices and filesystems. 
I stumbled upon this website when I'm searching about Linux pseudo device. 
It has both explainations and examples about some Linux pseudo devices as well as references to other reading materials. 

5. [Learn Linux, 101: Control mounting and unmounting of filesystems](https://developer.ibm.com/technologies/linux/tutorials/l-lpic1-104-3/)<br>
This is a basic tutorial on how to mount and unmounting filesystemss on Linux by IBM. 
It contains explaination of all important stuff including mounting, fstab, and swap space. 
The website is arranged in a neat way and probably worth checking out. 

6. [Awesome FUSE Filesystem](https://github.com/koding/awesome-fuse-fs)<br>
It's a github repo I stumbled upon when I'm searching about FUSE and filesystems. 
It contains all stuff related to FUSE from libraries, projects, along with external learning materials. 
No doubt, for me, github is always my go to for repositories on stuff related to something, like cheatsheets and learning materials. 

7. [Favorite partitioning and mounting tricks](https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/2408/favorite-partitioning-and-mounting-tricks)<br>
It's a stackexchange forum post related to stuff that you can do about linux filesystems. 
It's interesting because I learn some tips and tricks from experienced people on handling and managing Linux filesystemss. 
Some people laid out things related to FUSE and others give tricks on performance, probably worth checking out for beginers. 

8. [Journaling Filesystem Definition](http://www.linfo.org/journaling_filesystem.html)<br>
As the name implies, it's a website that explains about Linux journaling filesytems. 
I found it interesting because the website is laid out in simplistic and compact way. 
It also contains other stuff related to Linux and in each articles it links words that's related to other posts that's available on the website. 

9. [Working with tarballs on Linux](https://www.networkworld.com/article/3328840/working-with-tarballs-on-linux.html)<br>
It's an article written by Sandra Henry-Stocker about working with tarballs on Linux. 
Basicly, it's a tutorial on how to create and extract tarballs with examples and brief explaniation. 
Personally, I found the first image on the article a bit interesting (which is probably the image of a real life tarball and trivially explains the origin of it ?).

10. [Virtual Memory by Digital UNIX](http://www.mallorn.com/People/lindsey/test/c05.htm)<br>
It's a website that contains learning materials with regards to it's name. 
It's laid out in a very simplistic way with bite-sized informations on every sub-chapters. 
It also contains other learning materials in addition to Virtual Memory.
