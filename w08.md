# Top 10 List of Week 08

1. [CPU Scheduling](https://www.cs.uic.edu/~jbell/CourseNotes/OperatingSystems/5_CPU_Scheduling.html)<br>
This page of a course note from UIC explains about CPU Scheduling in general. 
It contains various information regarding the topic such as some basic concepts, criteria, algorithms, and many more. 
Although the page design is minimalists, the information laid out is comprehensive with images tu support further explanations.

2. [CPU Scheduling in OS | Scheduler and Dispatcher](https://www.notesjam.com/2018/07/cpu-scheduling-in-operating-system.html)<br>
This article from NotesJam talks about CPU Scheduling.
It contains materials regarding of the topic such as types of scheduling, dispatchers, and scheduling criteria.
This article laid the underlying fundamentals of the topic in concise way with an image that further support the explanations. 

3. [CPU Scheduling Criteria](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/cpu-scheduling-criteria/)<br>
This article from Geeks4Geeks explains about the criteria of CPU scheduling. 
It explains the 5 criteria, that is, CPU Utilization, Throughput, Turnaround time, Waiting time, and Response time. 
As usual, the topics explained in simple and concise way.

4. [Preemptive and Non-Preemptive Scheduling](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/preemptive-and-non-preemptive-scheduling/#)<br>
As the title suggests, it's another article from Geeks4Geeks that talks about Preemptive and Non-Preemptive Scheduling. 
It talks about the differences between the two, as well as the fundamental definitions. 
As usual, the information laid out is on-point accompanied with difference table that makes understanding the difference easier. 

5. [Multiple-Processor Scheduling](http://operatingsystempoly.blogspot.com/p/multiple-processor-scheduling.html)<br>
This blog post talks about scheduling in multiple processors. 
It contains sub-topics such as approaches in scheduling, processor affinity, load balancing, as well as virtualization and scheduling. 
It's interesting to see a blogspot article still laying around that provide useful information on such topic.

6. [Thread Scheduling](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/thread-scheduling/)<br>
Another article from Geeks4Geeks that talks about scheduling on threads. 
It talks about types of such scheduling, the scopes, domains, and the differences between the scopes. 
As usual, the information explained in concise and clear way that is easily digestible on light reading.

7. [Dispatch Latency](https://docs.oracle.com/cd/E19455-01/806-4750/chap7rt-21297/index.html#)<br>
This article from Oracle talks about Dispatch Latency. 
It contains various information regarding the topic such as the underlying definition, scheduling classes, as well as kernel priority inversion. 
It's interesting that the article is laid out in simple design while provide comprehensive information regarding the topic.

8. [Comparison of Scheduling Algorithms](https://www.studytonight.com/operating-system/comparision-scheduling-algorithms)<br>
As the title suggests, this article from Studytonight talks about scheduling algorithms. 
It talks about 4 algorithms such as First Come First Serve (FCFS), Shortest Job First (SJF), Round Robin (RR), and Priority based scheduling, as well as the use cases of such algorithms. 
It's a really useful article that explains briefly on the topic while suiting as a light reading.

9. [Scheduling in Real Time Systems](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/scheduling-in-real-time-systems/)<br>
This article from Geeks4Geeks talks about the case of scheduling in real time systems. 
It explains such definitions as well as the commonly used scheduling algorithms. 
It's interesting to see that such use cases uses different algorithms, thanks to Geeks4Geeks for explaining such topic in a simple way.

10. [Rate-monotonic scheduling](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/rate-monotonic-scheduling/#)<br>
Another article from Geeks4Geeks that talks about Rate-monotonic scheduling, a priority algorithm that's used on real time operating systems. 
It talks about the underlying definition, equations, some example, as well as the advantages and disadvantages of such scheduling. 
As described above, the article laid out the topic comprehensively with examples and graphic representation of the algorithm that greatly help the readers understanding.
